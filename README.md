This project is mainly to help me learn to use python using a structured rule set in place. This is not an attempt to make a full blown game or anything of that nature. What it is intented to do is help me grow as a Software Craftsman in developing complex data models while doing it towards something that I enjoy and can relate to.

##Structure
I don't really have one yet, but I will attempt to do more as I go. Normally, I would love to do this in Java or Scala. Using python will give me an opportunity to learn the language better.
